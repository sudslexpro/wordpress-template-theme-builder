The deployment process involves:

1. Selecting a WordPress site to deploy to
2. Choosing a theme or template to deploy

### What happens if a deployment fails?

If a deployment fails, the system provides detailed logs to help identify the cause of the failure. Depending on the deployment options selected, the system may also automatically roll back to the previous version to ensure your site remains functional.

### Can I deploy to staging environments?

Check these aspects and try the connection test again.
